            <p class="paragraph">After working in retail for over 16 years, selling high end leather goods in Aspinal of London 
                and Harrods or the latest gaming tech in GAME, I have started a new career in web design and 
                development with a focus on accessibility and the user experience. As different as these two 
                careers may seem at first glance I have found there are quite a few similarities between them, 
                and a lot of my experiences are transferable and beneficial. The customer service of in person 
                sales is the user experience of web design and development. 
            </p>
                
            <p>Much of what I enjoyed most about 
                working in retail was helping people find what it was they wanted and making the whole 
                experience a positive one, and that is exactly how I feel about being a front-end developer. 
                From creating an eye-catching window display and reorganising display units, to building a 
                rapport for customers and staying up to date with pertinent information, all of this is 
                encapsulated in the role of a web designer/developer. I take pride in my attention to customer 
                service, branding and accessibility, and look forward to applying my experience in customer 
                service to new opportunities in web UX/UI. In the end: new name, same game.
            </p>

            <p>Speaking of games, my greatest and longest lasting passion is video games. From a young age 
                they were my favourite medium of creativity and storytelling, as well as challenge and escapism. 
                More recently I have considered trying to get into the video games industry, and the idea of 
                designing and developing websites for games, developers or publishers is a very exciting prospect
                to me! Building a unique space for fans to visit and congregate to share their excitement and 
                receive updates, a place brimming with personality, all put together for an enjoyable experience. 
                In my own time I am learning game development and hope to one day develop my own game; at least I
                know Iâ€™ll be able to build a website for it!
